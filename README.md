# Zeioth Keyboard Firmware
All my keyboard firmwares in one repo, so you can find them easily.

## Wireless keyboards (ZMK)

[ZMK wireless Corne](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-zmk): I realized I never had my laptop with me, so instead I made this wireless keyboard to convert my current smartphone (Galaxy Fold 3) in a laptop. So I can code while I'm on the bus, or a physical workplace (like in times of the industrial revolution). 

* Recommended manteinance: Aditionally to the normal manteinance a crkbd keyboard requires, install a new LIPO battery every 5 years.

## Wired keyboards (QMK)

[QMK wired Corne](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-qmk): This is the one I use the most. It is not wireless, because for ocassional gaming I rather having that extra latency gain. Also, by not using wireles/battery, I make sure it is realiable/durable. 

* Recommended manteinance: Cleaning every 2 months. Re-lubing switches every 2 years. New switches/keycaps every 15 years.

## TODO
* Coming soon, I will release a firmware for trackpad instead of trackball, as the former has proven to have a very limited life span (around 1 year).
* Add cool photos or something.
