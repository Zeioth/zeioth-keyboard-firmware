# Keyboard firmware written by Zeioth
All my keyboard firmwares in one repo, so you can find the easily.

## Wireless keyboards (ZMK)

[Corne for traveling](https://github.com/Zeioth/zmk-config): I realized I never had my laptop with me, so instead I built/coded this wireless keyboard to convert my current smartphone (Galaxy Fold 3) in a laptop. So I can code while I'm on the bus, or a physical workplace (like in times of the industrial revolution). 

* Recommended manteinance: Aditionally to the normal manteinance a crkbd keyboard requires, it requires a new LIPO battery every 5 years.

## Wired keyboards (QMK)

[Corne](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-crkbd): This is the one I use the most. It is not wireless, because for ocassional gaming I rather having that extra latency gain. Also, by not using wireles/battery, I make sure it is realiable/durable. 

* Recommended manteinance: It requires re-lubing every 2 years. New switches/keycaps every 10 years.

## TODO
Add cool photos or something.
