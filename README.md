All my keyboard firmwares in one repo, so you can find the easily

## ZMK

* [Corne for traveling](https://github.com/Zeioth/zmk-config): I realized I never had my laptop with me, so instead I built/coded this wireless keyboard to convert my current smartphone (Galaxy Fold 3) in a laptop. So I can code while I'm on the bus or the train.

## QMK

* [Corne](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-crkbd): This is the one I use the most. This one is not wireless, because for ocassional gaming I rather having that extra latency gain. Also, not using wireles/battery make it more realiable/durable without any manteinance.

## TODO
Add cool photos or something.
